The webpage served as the main prototype for the E-Business Technologies course group project.
Throughout the course, as a team, we mock development of a start up from an idea to a deliverable pitch to investors by the end of course.
  (The panel of investors were professionals in their field: Co-founders, CEOs, Consultants, and our professor who's also a consultant)

Leon had originally focused on a high level overview of constructing the webpage, leading meetings, later became hands on developing it.
As the project progress through the Software Development Life Cycle, 
Leon gathered feedback, modified all changes to the webpage to befit functional requirements, and maintained within scope of project.

The webpage is a subdomain generated on the cPanel platform with all files (images, html, etc) within the 'File Manager'
